This is the API reference for the Application Enablement Services Device, Media and Call Control API.
This API provides an open, standards-based, Java programming interface
for developing applications that draw on the power of Avaya Communication
Manager software.
The API provides a form of first-party call control for developing applications
that:
<ul><li>gain exclusive or shared control of soft-phone enabled Communication Manager
		telephones or extensions</li>
	<li>perform telephone operations</li>
	<li>handle media</li>
	<li>detect and collect DTMF tones</li>
	<li>produce an encrypted media via RegistrationServices</li>
</ul>
These device- and media-control capabilities allow you to develop applications
that harness the extensive Avaya Communication Manager feature set available
via button presses, feature access codes, and media streams.
<p />
Device, Media and Call Control API is a software-only connector that provides
connectivity between applications and Communication Manager.
The connector consists of two components:
<dl>
	<dt><b>Connector Server Software</b></dt>
	<dd>Communicates with both the application and Communication Manager over
		an IP connection.
		Runs on a Linux machine separate from Communication Manager.</dd>
	<dt><b>Connector Client API Library</b></dt>
	<dd>A Java class library that provides a set of device- and media-control
		services.
		Transmits the applications requests to the connector server and
		translates the connector servers responses and asynchronous events
		into Java events for the application.
		The library is part of the software development kit (SDK) which also
		includes sample source code, a programmers guide, and this API
		reference (Javadoc).</dd>
</dl>
<p />
In an application, software objects, called DMCC soft-phones, are used to
represent soft-phone enabled, Communication Manager telephones or extensions.
Using the API, the application first requests exclusive control of a
telephone/extension in order to be given a DMCC soft-phone object.
The application can then perform telephone operations on the DMCC soft-phone
object.
This in turn causes the connector to make requests of Communication Manager
to perform those operations as if they were manually occurring on a physical
telephone.
In addition, Communication Manager asynchronously notifies the connector of
any event that occurs
on the telephone or extension, such as when a lamp becomes lit.
The connector then notifies the application of the event.
In this manner, an application can make calls, receive calls, record calls,
send announcements, apply tones, detect digits, and redirect the media.
<p />
More specifically, the connector client API library in this release
provides the following capabilities:
<ul><li>Instantiate a DMCC soft-phone that gains exclusive or shared
		control of a soft-phone-enabled,
		Communication Manager telephone/extension using
		<code>RegistrationServices</code>.</li>
	<li>Activate or control a DMCC soft-phones physical elements using
		<code>PhysicalDeviceServices</code>.
		This includes pressing buttons, going off hook, and going
		on hook.</li>
	<li>Determine the status of a DMCC soft-phones physical elements using
		<code>PhysicalDeviceServices</code>.
		This includes obtaining the status of buttons, displays,
		lamps, the hook-switch, the message waiting indicator, and the
		ringer.</li>
	<li>Detect events on a DMCC soft-phones physical elements using
		<code>PhysicalDeviceListener</code>.
		This includes detecting events on the displays, lamps, and
		ringer.</li>
	<li>Process the media in any of the following ways:
	<ul><li>Record media from a call into a Wave file using
			<code>VoiceUnitServices</code>.
			Wave files can be in PCM, G.711, G.729, or G.729A CODEC file
			formats.</li>
		<li>Dub a recording with the contents of another compatible Wave file
			using <code>ExtendedVoiceUnitServices</code></li>
		<li>Play a voice announcement or tone, which is pre-recorded in a Wave
			file, on a device
			using <code>VoiceUnitServices</code>.</li>
		<li>Detect in-band or out-of-band DTMF digits using
			<code>ToneDetectionServices</code>
			(in-band DTMF detection not available for
			G.729/G.729A codecs).</li>
		<li>Collect a series of in-band or out-of-band DTMF digits using
			<code>ToneCollectionServices</code>
			(in-band DTMF collection not available for
			G.729/G.729A codecs).</li>.
	</ul>
		For all of the above media processing, the Wave files are placed on,
		or retrieved from, the connector server hardware.</li>
	<li>Direct the media to another IP address to bypass the connector server
		media processing
		using <code>RegistrationServices</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p />
The types of applications that can be supported in this release include,
but are not limited to:
<ul><li>IP call recording applications</li>
	<li>IP soft-phone applications</li>
	<li>Messaging applications</li>
	<li>Alert and notify applications</li>
	<li>Specialized console applications</li>
	<li>Other applications that require device- or physical-level telephony
	control with media</li>
</ul>
The connector can control certain Communication Manager DCP and IP
telephones and extensions
when they are administered for soft-phone access.

This API supports the ECMA telephony standard called Computer Supported
Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase III.
This standard is specified in publication ECMA-269,
<i>Services for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA)
Phase III</i>, 5th Edition, December 2002 found at
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">http://www.ecma-international.org</a>).
The Device, Media and Call Control API library provides a Java-binding to a subset of
the CSTA XML protocol whose specifications can be found in publication ECMA-323,
<i>XML Protocol for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA)
Phase III</i>, 2nd Edition, December 2002.

<b><font size="+1">Finding the information you need</font></b>
<p />
<b>High-level vs. Low-level Classes:</b>
When you bring up Javadoc, you see a list of classes in the lower, left-hand
frame.
Note that it lists only the API's "high-level" interfaces and classes.
The "lower-level" interfaces and classes (Java beans) can only be reached from
the high-level services that use them.
For example, to see the documentation for the <tt>ButtonPress</tt> request
class,
go to <tt>PhysicalDeviceServices</tt> and then click on the
<tt>ButtonPress</tt> link
shown in the <tt>pressButton()</tt> method description.
<p /><b>Implementation Specifics:</b>
As you use this documentation, be aware that the implementation specifics you
need to know
are reflected in the Javadoc of the high-level services
(such as <tt>PhysicalDeviceServices</tt>) and <i>not</i> in the Javadoc for
Java beans
that represent requests and responses
(such as <tt>PressButton</tt> and <tt>PressButtonResponse</tt>).
Implementation specifics that you need to know include:
<ul><li>Avaya values that must be used in fields that CSTA has specified as
"switching function specific".</li>
<li>which of the CSTA multiple choices Avaya has implemented</li>
<li>which of the CSTA optional parameters Avaya has implemented</li>
</ul>
The Javadoc for the Java beans reflect the full CSTA specification and
not the subset that Avaya has implemented.
Refer to the high-level services that use a Java bean to determine
implementation specifics of that class.

<b><font size="+1">Basics of writing an application</font></b>
<p />
The outline of your application code will look something like this:
<ol>
<li>Get an instance of <code>ServiceProvider</code> and then
use its <code>get</code>XXX<code>Service</code> methods to obtain
instances of any of the services you wish to use.</li>
<li>For the desired device, get a device ID object using the <code>getDeviceID()</code> method
of <code>DeviceServices</code>.
This ID will be used hereafter to refer to this device.</li>
<li>Register the device you want to have exclusive or shared control over
using the <code>registerTerminal()</code>
method of <code>RegistrationServices</code>.</li>
<li>Operate on the device using:
	<ul><li><code>PhysicalDeviceServices</code></li>
	<li><code>VoiceUnitServices</code></li>
	<li><code>ExtendedVoiceUnitServices</code></li>
	<li><code>ToneDetectionServices</code></li>
	<li><code>ToneCollectionServices</code></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>When finished with the device, unregister the device using the
<code>unregisterTerminal()</code> method of <code>RegistrationServices</code> and
release the device using the <code>releaseDeviceID()</code> method of
<code>DeviceServices</code>.</li>
</ol>
To be asynchronously notified of events, your application must also implement
the following:
<ol><li>For each type of event you wish to act upon for any given service,
implement a call-back method for every possible event in a
listener interface (such as <code>PhysicalDeviceListener</code>)
or implement select call-backs in an adapter
(such as <code>PhysicalDeviceAdapter</code>).</li>
<li>Add your listener to each device
using MonitoringServices' <code>add</code><i>XXX</i><code>Listener</code> method
(such as <code>monitoringDeviceServices.addPhysicalDeviceListener()</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p />
