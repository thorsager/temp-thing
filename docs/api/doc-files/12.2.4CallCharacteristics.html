</head>
<body>
<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section
12.2.4, "Call Characteristics".</i>
<h3>
12.2.4 CallCharacteristics</h3>
The CallCharacteristics parameter type describes, when included on an event,
the high level characteristics
associated with a call.
<p>When this parameter is included on a switching function service request,
it indicates the requested set of high level
characteristics that should be associated with the call.
<p><b>Format</b>
<p>This parameter type is a bitmap. Multiple bits may be set. The complete
set of possible values in the bitmap is:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
acdCall. This bit is set to indicate an ACD call. Once the call is no longer
associated with the ACD, this bit is no longer set. See Functional Requirement
#1.</li>

<li>
lowPriorityCall - This bit is set to indicate that the priority level associated
with the call is low.</li>

<li>
priorityCall - This bit is set to indicate that the priority level assocaited
with the call is normal.</li>

<li>
highPriorityCall - This bit is set to indicate that the priority level
associated with the call is high.</li>

<li>
maintenanceCall - This bit is set to indicate a maintenance call.</li>

<li>
directAgent - This bit is set to indicate a call placed directly to a particular
agent.</li>

<li>
assistCall - This bit is set to indicate a call whose purpose is to request
assistance.</li>

<li>
voiceUnitCall - This bit is set to indicate a call involving a Voice Unit
(e.g., voice mail system). Once the Voice Unit is no longer involved with
the call, this bit is no longer set.</li>

<li>
privateCall - This bit is set to indicate that the sensitivity of the call
is private.</li>

<li>
personalCall - This bit is set to indicate that the sensitivity of the
call is personal.</li>

<li>
sensitiveCall - This bit is set to indicate that the sensitivity of the
call is normal.</li>

<li>
confidentialCall - This bit is set to indicate that the sensitivity of
the call is confidential.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<b>Functional Requirements</b>
<blockquote>1.There are many conditions when a switching function may classify
a call as an ACD call and when an ACD
call becomes a non-ACD call. The specific conditions are switching
function dependent.
<p>2.If multiple priority and/or security values are indicated, it is suggested
(but not required) that the highest value
should be used. The levels of sensitivity are (in increasing order):
privateCall, personalCall, sensitiveCall, and
confidentialCall. The levels of priority are (in increasing order):
lowPriorityCall, priorityCall, and
highPriorityCall.</blockquote>
