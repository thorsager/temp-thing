<body>
<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269,
Section 12.3.24, "RedirectionDeviceID".</i>
<h3>
12.3.24 RedirectionDeviceID</h3>
The RedirectionDeviceID parameter type describes the last device known
by the switching function from which the
current call was routed. “Routed” includes forwarded from, diverted
from, or redirected from.
<h4>
Format and Status</h4>
This device identifier type may be one of the following (see <a href="10CSTADeviceIdentifierFormats.html">CSTADeviceIdentifierFormats</a>
for more information ):
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;a character string when using the Diallable Digits and the Switching
Function Representation formats.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;an integer value when using the Device Number format.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;“Provided” - indicates that the DeviceID of the last redirection
device is provided.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;“Not Known” - indicates that the call has been redirected but the
switching function cannot provide the DeviceID.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;“Not Required” - indicates that the current call has never been redirected
during the existence of the call.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;“Not Specified” - indicates that the switching function cannot determine
whether or not the call has ever been redirected.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;“Restricted” - provided when the device cannot be provided due to
regulatory and/or privacy reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Functional Requirements</h4>
The information in a device identifier of this type will stay with the
call until the call is established. If the call
is routed multiple time before it is established, then the information
in this parameter will be updated to the last
known device from which the call was routed. If the call was redirected
from a device, but the device identifier
is unknown, “Not Known” shall be used. Depending on the capabilities
of the switching function, the last
known device for the call might be reflected by only one device identifier
and in actuality the call might have
been routed several times before arriving at the final destination.
<p>Note that in the case of Immediate Forwarding, where forwarding is triggered
before the call is delivered to a
device, the lastRedirectionDevice in the event associated with the
delivery of the call to a new device (after it
was immediately forwarded) shall contain “Not Known”. Refer to <a href="6.8.1Forwarding.html">Forwarding</a>
for more information .
