   <title>12.2.27 User Data</title>
</head>
<body>
<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section 12.2.27,
"User Data".</i>
<h4>
12.2.27 UserData</h4>
The UserData parameter type contains computing sub-domain to computing
sub-domain data. Note that the capabilities exchange services return the
maximum length of the user data for a switching function.
<p>User Data is described further in <a href="6.1.4.4UserData.html">6.1.4.4UserData</a>.
Also, refer to <a href="12.2.10CorrelatorData.html">12.2.10CorrelatorData</a>.&nbsp;
Annex B defines one possible mechanism for delivering user data through
an external ISDN network.
<h4>
Format</h4>
This parameter type is an octet string. The maximum length supported by
the switching function is provided via the capabilities exchange services.
<h4>
Functional Requirements</h4>

<ol>
<li>
The ability to send User Data, the timing of when user data can be sent,
and the size of user data, is dependent upon the switching function’s capabilities
and the underlying network (such as ISDN).</li>

<li>
Unlike correlator data, User Data is not attached to a call for the life
of the call. User Data that has been associated with a primary or secondary
call does not get retained with a resulting conference or transferred call.</li>

<li>
The switching function reflects the delivery of User Data in the call control
events that result from the switching function or network carrying out
the call control activity with which the User Data was associated. When
the switching function receives user data independent of call activity
(i.e., Send User Information service), the User Data is provided in the
Call Information event.</li>

<li>
User data addresses a specific user in a call (e.g. the initially called
device). The delivery and propagation of the user data to other devices
inside the switching sub-domain in regards to features that apply to the
call (e.g. forwarding, do not disturb) is switching function dependent.</li>

<li>
When this data is being attached to a call through a service request, its
association shall be completed prior to any state transitions resulting
from the request. Thus any state transition events which contain this parametershall
contain the&nbsp; information passed on the request.</li>

<li>
If a computing function issues a Snapshot Call service after a service
request has been issued with this information, but prior to the switching
function making any state transitions, it is switching function specific
as to what will be returned in the positive acknowledgement with regards
to this parameter.</li>
</ol>
