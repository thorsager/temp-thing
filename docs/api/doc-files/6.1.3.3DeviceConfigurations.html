<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269,
Section 6.1.3.3, "Device Configurations".</i>
<h4>
6.1.3.3 Device Configurations</h4>
A <i>device configuration</i> describes the arrangement of the various
elements and appearances that can be directly
associated with a given device. Multiple device configurations may
be formed from the possible combinations of
physical elements, logical elements, and different appearance types.
<p>Device configurations are described in terms of a specific device configuration
for a particular device:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Device’s element combination</i> - This indicates whether the device
has a physical element only, a logical element only or both a logical and
physical element.</li>

<li>
<i>Other devices using the physical element</i> - This indicates the list
of devices (i.e., their logical elements) that are using the physical element
of the base device.</li>

<li>
<i>Other devices using the logical element</i> - This indicates the list
of devices (i.e., their physical elements) that are using the logical element
of the base device.</li>

<li>
<i>The logical element’s appearance addressability </i>- This is an attribute
of the appearances of the logical element of the base device (if the logical
element is present).</li>

<li>
<i>The logical element’s appearance type</i> - This is an attribute of
the appearances of the logical element of the base device (if the logical
element is present).</li>

<li>
<i>The number of appearances associated with the logical element</i> -
This is an attribute of the logical element of the base device (if the
logical element is present).</li>
</ul>
As a set, these attributes describe the device configuration for a specific
device. The following sections illustrate
typical examples of device configurations that can exist in a switching
sub-domain.
<p>Note that in the following examples, where physical and logical elements
form part of the same device, the
application of a suffix number to the identifying letter identifies
that they are parts of the same device (e.g. L1, P1
are a single device; L1, P2 are elements from different devices).
