<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section
6.1.4.3, "Correlator Data".</i>
<h4>
6.1.4.3 Correlator Data</h4>
Correlator Data is computing function specific data which has been attached
to a call that a computing function is controlling or observing. This information,
for example, might be a key to a database entry, an application command
sequence, file name, etc. Once Correlator Data is associated with a call,
it remains with the call for its entire duration (at least one CSTA Device
is actively involved in the call), or until the computing function overwrites
the data with new data. In order to remove data, the computing function
shall overwrite the existing data with null data. Correlator Data enters
the switching sub-domain in two ways:
<ul>
<li>
A computing function provides Correlator Data on a service request (e.g.
Call Control and Call Associated services).</li>

<li>
Correlator Data arrives from an external network connection with a call
(for example, Correlator Data may be used as a key to pop a screen for
the call). This Standard defines one possible mechanism for delivering
Correlator Data through an external network. This mechanism is described
in Annex B.</li>
</ul>
Permitting a computing function to associate its own information with a
call allows multiple computing functions to share data on calls which they
are all controlling or observing. This feature is useful when calls are
moving from one computing function to another in a distributed computer
network or from one switching sub-domain to another. For more information
on Correlator Data, refer to <a href="12.2.10CorrelatorData.html">12.2.10CorrelatorData</a>.
<p>Correlator Data is provided by the Computing Function and associated
with the call for its entire duration or until overwritten with new data.
This data survives Conference and Transfer and can be provided on various
events. An application may remove the Correlator Data by overwriting existing
data with null data.
<p>When Correlator Data is associated with a call, call events that indicate
that a CSTA Device has become part of a call (such as Delivered, Established
and Queued events, for example) shall include the Correlator Data (if this
parameter is supported in the event being reported). Subsequent call events
also may contain the Correlator Data.
<p>Note that “null Correlator Data” means Correlator Data information with
zero length.
<p>When a consultation call is transferred or conferenced and null or non-null
Correlator Data is associated with the secondary call, the Correlator Data
in the resulting call shall always be the same Correlator Data that was
associated with the secondary call (even if only the primary call had non-null
Correlator Data). In that case the Correlator Data (if any) associated
with the primary call is discarded. If the secondary call contains no Correlator
Data, the Correlator Data associated with the resulting call is that which
was associated with the primary call.

<p>When Correlator Data is associated with a call via the Associate Data
service, the Call Information event is provided by the switching function.
If the data is changed by any other service, the switching function does
not provide the Call Information event.
