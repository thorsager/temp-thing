<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269,
Section 12.2.18, "Media Call Characteristics".</i>
<h3>
12.2.18 MediaCallCharacteristics</h3>
The MediaCallCharacteristics parameter type specifies the media (voice,
digital data, etc.) characteristics of the call.
<p><b>Format</b>
This parameter type is comprised of the following:
<p>1. mediaClass (M) Bitmap - Specifies the media class (voice, digital
data, etc.).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A CSTA call shall belong to at least one and may
belong to more than one of the following classes:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Audio - 3.1 KHz audio. Calls in this class involve devices that are used
to make audio calls excluding speech calls. This includes calls involving
devices such as G3 FAX and facsimile machines.</li>

<li>
Chat - A type of Data class call that involves text-based messages that
are exchanged between devices in the call using electronic media. A chat
call is interactive since devices in the call can participate at the same
time (i.e. originate and receive messages during the call.) The Data class
bit must also be set for a Chat call.</li>

<li>
Data - This class of calls involve digital data calls (both circuit switched
and packet switched). Calls in this class include devices such as digital
computer interfaces and G4 facsimile machines.</li>

<li>
Email - This class of calls involve a text-based message that is sent using
electronic media. This is a noninteractive call (i.e. only one device involved
with the call at one time). This is a specific type of mediaClass associated
with electronic mail systems.</li>

<li>
Image - Digital data calls involving imaging, or high-speed, circuit-switched
data in general. This includes calls involving devices such as digital
video telephones and CODECs.</li>

<li>
Message - This class of calls involve a text-based message that is sent
using electronic media. This is a non-interactive call (i.e. only one device
is involved with the call at one time). The message contents associated
with these calls can usually be displayed on the called devices. Instant
Messages (IM), Short Message Service (SMS) are examples of this mediaClass.</li>

<li>
Voice - Speech calls. This class of calls involves devices such as standard
telephones.</li>

<li>
Not Known - The media class is not known.</li>

<li>
Other - A class of call not belonging to one of the specified mediaClass.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
2. connectionRate (O) Value - The digital data connection rate of the call.
The contents of this parameter is
switching function specific (the capability exchange services may be
used to obtain the list of possible values
that are supported by the switching function). A value of zero (0)
indicates that the type of media stream
associated with the connection is digital data but the connection rate
is unknown.
<p>3. bitRate (O) Enumerated - The digital data bit rate of the call. If
this parameter is not present, the bit rate of the
call is a constant bit. The following is the complete set of possible
values:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Constant (Default) - A bit rate which ensures a dedicated bandwidth and
a constant rate of media stream delivery.</li>

<li>
Variable - A bit rate which may variable during the life of the call.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
4. delayTolerance (O) Value - The digital data delay tolerance of the call.
This parameter specifies the maximum
amount of media stream delivery delay that will be toleranced for the
call. If the bit rate is constant, then this
value will indicate the actual amount of media stream delivery delay
for the life of the call. Where as if the bit
rate is variable, it will be the maximum delay allowed during the life
of the call. The contents of this parameter
is switching function specific, use the capability exchange services
to obtain the list of possible values that are
supported by the switching function. If this parameter is not present,
the delay tolerance of the call is not
known.
<p>5. switchingSubDomainCCIEType (O) Enumerated - The type of switching
sub-domain private call control
information elements that are present in the switchingSubDomainInformationElements
parameter. If this
parameter is not present, there are no information elements associated
with the call and the
switchingSubDomainInformationElements parameter should be ignored.
The following is the complete set of
possible values:
<blockquote>• ISDN
• ATM (B-ISDN)
• ISO-Ethernet (TDM part only)
• RSVP
• SIP
• Other (switching sub-domain specific)</blockquote>
6. switchingSubDomainInformationElements (C) Characters - These parameters
contain the private information
elements that are available from the switching sub-domain (as specified
by switchingSubDomainCCIEType)
which represents a specific set of information elements. The format,
meaning and behaviour of these
information elements are specific to the given switching function.
This parameter is only present and
mandatory when the switchingSubDomainCCIEType parameter is present.
