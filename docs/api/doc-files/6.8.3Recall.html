<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section 6.8.3,
"Recall".</i>
<h3>
6.8.3 Recall</h3>
The Recall feature is a trigger that is associated with a call after a
specific call control feature has been executed.
When this feature is executed, it redirects or presents the call either
back to the device on who’s behalf the call
control feature was executed or to a switching function administrated
destination associated with the specific call
control feature. There are several types of call control services which
can have this feature associated with them. For
example:
<ul>
<li>
Hold Call</li>

<li>
Transfer Call</li>

<li>
Single Step Transfer Call</li>

<li>
Deflect Call</li>

<li>
Park Call</li>
</ul>
The event sequence associated with this feature is the Diverted event (only
if the device to whom the call is being
redirected is not already in the call) and the first event associated
with the delivery of the call to the new device or
the device that performed the call control feature. The characteristics
for this event sequence are:
<ul>
<li>
The Diverted event will have an appropriate recall event cause. This event
is only reported when the device to whom the call is being redirected is
not already in the call (i.e., a recall to a connection that is already
in the call). (Note that the reporting of this event is dependent on the
capabilities of the switching function.)</li>

<li>
The first event associated with the delivery of the call to the new device
(i.e. Delivered), or the device that performed the call control feature
will have an appropriate recall event cause (in either the Delivered, Held,
Queued, etc.). If the lastRedirectionDevice parameter is available in this
event, and the call was actually redirected to another device outside the
current call, then it will be provided based upon the definition for this
parameter. (Refer to the definition of the Call Control events and lastRedirectionDevice
parameter for more details.) If the callingDevice parameter is available
in this event, it may contain the same callingDevice information prior
to the recall. This means that if the calling device is the Subject Device
of the event, then the information in the callingDevice and corresponding
SubjectDeviceID (e.g., Delivered event SubjectDeviceID = alertingDevice)
parameters may be the same. If the switching function does not retain this
information with the call, then the callingDevice parameter will contain
a value of “Not Known”.</li>
</ul>
