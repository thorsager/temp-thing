<h2>
6.2 Special Resource Functions</h2>
Special Resource Functions (SRFs) are functions that are typically “added-on”
to a Switching or Computing
<br>Function. They can be modeled as part of either one of the two other
Functions or as something totally independent.
<p>A Special Resource Function may provide various functions, such as voice
unit services, conference bridge, fax,
<br>video, or speech recognition, to the Switching and/or Computing Functions.
