<h2>G.729 Wave File Format</h2>
All digit audio files used in Communication Manager API are in
<a href="http://www.sonicspot.com/guide/wavefiles.html">
standard Wave file format</a>,
including these audio files:
<ul><li>Files created using <tt>VoiceUnitServices.recordMessage()</tt>
		</li>
	<li>Files played to a media stream using <tt>VoiceUnitServices.playMessage()
		</tt></li>
	<li>Files used to dub over a recording using
		<tt>ExtendedVoiceUnitServices.startDubbing()</tt></li>
</ul>
<p />
However, since the Wave file standard does not accomodate
G.729 encoding, some <i>non-standard</i> field values are used
in the format chunk of the Wave file's RIFF structure
to distinguish those encoded with G.729:
<ul><li>The compression code value is 131 (0x0083). </li>
 <li>The block align value is 10 (0x000A). </li>
 <li>The bits per sample value is 1 (0x0001). </li>
</ul>
<p />
An external G.729 converter is
required to convert a G.729 Wave file into a standard Wave file format
that can be played.
