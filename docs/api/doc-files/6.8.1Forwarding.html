   <title>6.8.1 Forwarding</title>
</head>
<body>
<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section 6.8.1,
"Forwarding".</i>
<h3>
6.8.1 Forwarding</h3>
The forwarding feature is a trigger at a device that will redirect incoming
calls to another device based on a specific condition. The following are
the types of conditions that would trigger the redirection, or forwarding
of the incoming call:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Immediate</i> - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a
device, it is immediately redirected to another device.</li>

<li>
<i>Busy</i> - This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a device,
and the device is busy with another call, then the incoming call will be
redirected to another device.</li>

<li>
<i>No Answer </i>- This condition indicates that if a call arrives at a
device, and the call is not answered within a certain number of rings or
within a specific amount of time, then the incoming call will be redirected
to another device.</li>

<li>
<i>Do Not Disturb (DND)</i> - This condition indicates that if a call arrives
at a device, and the device has the Do Not Disturb feature active at the
device, then the incoming call will be redirected to another device. Note
that the Do Not Disturb feature does not necessarily imply that incoming
calls are forwarded.</li>

<li>
<i>Type of Call Origination</i> - This condition indicates that if a call
arrives at a device, and the originating device is a specific class (i.e.,
external, such as a device that is outside the switching sub-domain, or
internal, such as a device that is within the switching sub-domain), then
the incoming call will be redirected to another device. This condition
can be used in combination with the others to create a compound condition.
For example, if busy with another call and the calling device is outside
the switching sub-domain, then redirect the call to another device.</li>
</ul>
Switching functions may support one or both of the following levels of
forwarding settings:
<ul>
<li>
switching function default settings</li>

<li>
User specified settings</li>
</ul>
<i>Switching function default settings</i> are a single set of forwarding-type/forward-destination
combinations that can be activated and deactivated as a set. The set includes
all of the CSTA forwarding-types defined and the forwarddestinations for
each type. Activation, deactivation, or changes to the forward-destinations
are not normally possible by users.
<p><i>User specified settings</i> are individual forwarding-type/forward-destination
combinations that can be activated or deactivated one at a time. User specified
settings supersede switching function default settings during activation,
deactivation, and when forwarding occurs.
<p>A switching function that supports switching function default settings
may also support user specified settings. Switching function default settings
are used for forwarding to a standard destination such as voice mail or
an attendant. User specified settings may be used to override the default
settings to forward calls temporarily to another office, for example.
<p>A user specified forwarding type supersedes the same switching function
default forwarding type when forwarding occurs. For example, a user specified
type of “No Answer” and its corresponding forward destination supersede
a switching function default type of “No Answer”. Note that this rule may
not apply to types that are not alike. For example, a user specified type
of “No Answer” (a delayed type of forwarding) does not supersede a switching
function default type of “Immediate”, although a user specified type of
“Immediate” does supersede a switching function default type of “No Answer”
(since “No Answer” is a delayed type of forwarding).
<p>The forwarding feature has service requests and events to control and
observe the activation and deactivation of the forwarding triggers at the
device (i.e., Get Forward, Set Forward, Forwarding). These service requests
and events are documented in Clause 22, “Logical Device Features”, beginning
on page 456, and do not actually forward the incoming call when it arrives
at the device, but instead sets up the trigger to cause the switching function
to perform the redirecting of the call. The computing function should use
the capabilities exchange services to determine which of these services
and events the switching function supports.
<p>The computing function should use the capabilities exchange services
to determine which of the following levels of forwarding settings are supported
by the switching function:
<ul>
<li>
Switching function default settings (set of forwarding types and forward
destinations).</li>

<li>
User specified settings.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Default forwarding type.</li>

<li>
Default forward destination.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Switching function default settings may be activated or deactivated manually
at the device, or by providing neither the forwarding type nor forward
destination (forward DN) in Set Forward service requests.
<p>User specified settings may be activated or deactivated manually at
the device or by providing the forwarding type and/or the forward destination
(forward DN) in the Set Forward service request. If the forwarding type
is not specified and the forward destination is specified, the switching
function uses a default forwarding type. Likewise, if the forwarding type
is specified and the forward destination is not specified, the switching
function uses a default forward destination.
<p>The computing function is informed that default settings are being activated
in the Get Forward positive acknowledgement and the Forwarding event.
<p>When the call is immediately redirected as a result of the forwarding
feature, there are two basic event sequence models to indicate that the
call has been forwarded. The following are the event sequence model definitions
(Note that the computing function should use the capabilities exchange
services to determine which of model or models that the switching function
supports.):
<ul>
<li>
<i>Forwarding Is Triggered before the Call Is Delivered to the Device</i>
- - There is basically no event sequence</li>

<br>associated with this condition. The only characteristic associated
with this event sequence is:
<ul>
<li>
The first event associated with the delivery of the call to the new device
will have an appropriate forwarding event cause. If the RedirectionDeviceID
parameter is available in this event, it will be provided based upon the
definition of the Call Control event and&nbsp; <a href="12.3.24RedirectionDeviceID.html">RedirectionDeviceID</a>&nbsp;
(see <a href="6.8.6TrackingaDivertedCall.html">Tracking a Diverted Call</a>
for more information on event sequences for forwarded calls)</li>
</ul>
If the call is forwarded multiple times under the same condition (e.g.,
forwarded from device 1 to device 2 which is forwarded to device 3), then
the information indicating that the call was forwarded will only be the
information from the last device the call was forwarded from (e.g., device
2). As a result, the computing function will only see that the call has
been forwarded one time.
<li>
<i>Forwarding Is Triggered after the Call Is Delivered to the Device</i>
- The event sequence is a Diverted event followed by the first event associated
with the delivery of the call to the new device. The characteristics associated
with this event sequence are:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Depending on the capabilities of the switching function, an Offered and/or
Delivered event may or may not flow as a result of presenting the to-be-forwarded
call to the device from which it will be diverted.</li>

<li>
The Diverted event will have an appropriate forwarding event cause. (Note
that he reporting of this event is dependent on the capabilities of the
switching function.)</li>

<li>
The first event associated with the delivery of the call to the new device
will have an appropriate forwarding event cause. If the RedirectionDeviceID
parameter is available in this event, it will be provided based upon the
definition of the Call Control event and&nbsp; <a href="12.3.24RedirectionDeviceID.html">RedirectionDeviceID</a>&nbsp;
(see <a href="6.8.6TrackingaDivertedCall.html">Tracking a Diverted Call</a>
for more information on event sequences for forwarded calls)</li>
</ul>

<li>
If the call is forwarded multiple times under the same condition (e.g.,
forwarded from device 1 to device 2 which is forwarded to device 3), then
the information indicating that the call was forwarded will be available
each time the call is forwarded (e.g., device 1, device 2). This is possible
because the call is actually delivered to the device before it is forward
to another.</li>
</ul>
If the call is forwarded multiple times with a mixture of forwarding conditions
(i.e., event sequence types), then the information indicating that the
call was forwarded will be a mixture of the event sequences depending on
the order of the forwarding conditions.
