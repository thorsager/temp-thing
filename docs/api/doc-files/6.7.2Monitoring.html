<h3>
6.7.2 Monitoring</h3>
To track call control and other activity, and to receive notification of
all changes in the switching Function, the
computing function uses a feature called monitoring. By starting a
monitor, the computing function indicates that it
wants to be notified of specific changes that occur in the objects
(call and device) and device attributes of a
switching function. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>
Notification that a call has arrived at a device.</li>

<li>
Notification that a call has been answered.</li>

<li>
Notification that a feature such as “Forwarding” or “Do Not Disturb” has
changed at a device.</li>
</ul>
Once a monitor is established, the switching function notifies the computing
function of relevant activity by sending
messages called event reports, or simply events.
<p>For example, in the area of Call Control, events report the state transitions
through which connections pass. In this
way a computing function is able to determine what services are applicable
to a given connection. For example, the
Delivered event indicates when a connection state transits to the Alerting
state.
<p>The event categories are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Call Control - These events report changes to information related to calls.</li>

<li>
Call Associated - These events report changes to information related to
calls.</li>

<li>
Media Stream - These events report changes associated with attachment of
a call to a media device.</li>

<li>
Physical Device - These events report changes to the components of a device's
physical element.</li>

<li>
Logical Device - These events report changes to feature settings associated
with a device's logical element(s).</li>

<li>
Voice Unit - These events report changes to Voice Unit messages.</li>

<li>
Maintenance - These events report changes regarding maintenance.</li>

<li>
Private - These events are switching function specific.</li>
</ul>
