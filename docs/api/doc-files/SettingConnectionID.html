<h2>Setting a Connection Identifier</h2>
Communication Manager API does not yet work with full connection identifiers.
It works with device identifiers instead.
CSTA has ConnectionIDs in many service requests and responses, but
only the DeviceID portion is used by this API. Here is a coding example of
how you could set the DeviceID portion of a ConnectionID assuming you
had already obtained a DeviceID called "deviceID" from DeviceServices:
<p />
<pre>
ConnectionID connID = new ConnectionID();
LocalDeviceID localDeviceID = new LocalDeviceID();
localDeviceID.setStaticID(deviceID);
connID.setDeviceID(localDeviceID);
</pre>
