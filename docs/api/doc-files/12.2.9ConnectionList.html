<body>
<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section
12.2.9, "Connection List".</i>
<h3>
12.2.9 ConnectionList</h3>
The ConnectionList parameter type provides the linkage mechanism between
a device’s old connection ID and new
connection ID resulting from the conference or transfer.
<h4>
F<b>ormat</b></h4>
This parameter includes the following components for every device or connection
being reported.
<ul>
<li>
new ConnectionID (C) ConnectionID - The CallID portion of this ConnectionID
refers to the resulting call. This component is optional for the transferringDevice
in the Transferred event, otherwise it is mandatory.</li>

<li>
old ConnectionID (C) ConnectionID - The CallID portion of this ConnectionID
refers to the original call. This component is mandatory if the switching
function previously reported the CallID, otherwise it is optional.</li>

<li>
endPoint DeviceID (O) DeviceID - For internal calls, this is the representation
of the device inside the switching sub-domain. For external calls (incoming
or outgoing), this is the representation of the externally located device
(if known by the switching function). This component is a character string.
The maximum length supported by the switching function is provided via
the capabilities exchange services. It may be:</li>

<ul>
<li>
of any device identifier format</li>

<li>
of the following statuses: “Provided” “Not Known” “Restricted”</li>
</ul>

<li>
associatedNID (C) DeviceID - For external calls (incoming and/or outgoing),
this component specifies the Network Interface Device (e.g., trunk, CO
line) within the switching sub-domain that is associated with the externally
located device. In that case the component endPoint DeviceID (if provided)
shall represent the externally located device. The associatedNID component
is mandatory in case of external calls and shall be omitted when the device
is located inside the switching sub-domain. This component may be:</li>

<ul>
<li>
of any device identifier format</li>

<li>
of the following statuses: “Provided” or “Not Known”</li>
</ul>

<li>
resultingConnectionInformation (O) ConnectionInformation - This component
contains the flow direction and channel characteristics associated with
the resulting connection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Functional Requirements</h4>

<ol>
<li>
This list should be used by the computing function to associate devices
which remain in a call, as a result of a Conference or Transfer, with the
connection IDs that are used to manipulate them.</li>
</ol>
