<h3>
6.8.6 Tracking a Diverted Call</h3>
When observing a call or a device in a call, and the call diverts from
a device in the call, the computing function
<br>shall use the Diverted event to track the progress of the call as a
result of the redirection.
<br>If the switching function does not provide the Diverted event for all
devices in a call or for call-type monitors (as
<br>indicated through the capabilities exchange services), the computing
function shall use parameters in the first event
<br>after the call has been diverted to properly track the progress of
the call as a result of the redirection. The device
<br>identifiers are used to observe the movement of the call and the event
cause is provided to indicate what caused the
<br>movement of the call. (Note that the call may have been diverted several
times between the previous event (if one
<br>was generated) and the first event after the diversion. As a result,
the computing function can only ascertain that
<br>either one or two redirections have occurred.)
