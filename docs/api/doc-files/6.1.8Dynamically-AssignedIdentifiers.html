<h3>
6.1.8 Management of Dynamically-Assigned Identifiers</h3>
Management of dynamically-assigned Device Identifiers and Call Identifiers
is provided through management of
<br>Connection Identifiers. This ensures that an identifier whose meaning
is dependent on another identifier is always
<br>provided in the proper context (i.e., with the other identifier needed
to resolve its meaning). For example if a Call
<br>Identifier is given relative to a device, then giving the Connection
Identifier ensures that the Call Identifier is
<br>provided with its reference - the Device Identifier. Management of
Connection Identifiers shall be provided as
<br>follows.
<p>Connection Identifiers shall be provided when either a new Call is created
or a new device becomes involved in a
<br>call. When a call is made a Connection Identifier shall be provided.
A Connection Identifier shall be provided in
<br>Event Reports that pertain to a call. When a device becomes involved
in a call, the Connection Identifier shall be
<br>provided in the Event Reports that occur at that device.
<p>If a call changes its Call Identifier when a Conference or Transfer
occurs, Connection Identifiers shall be provided
<br>to link the old Call Identifier to the new Call Identifier. Similarly,
if a Device Identifier is changed, new Connection
<br>Identifiers shall be provided for the devices in the call.
<p>Management of identifiers shall be provided via parameters included
in Service acknowledgements and Event
<br>Reports.
<p>Identifiers shall cease to be valid when their context vanishes. If
a call ends, its Call Identifier is no longer valid to
<br>refer to that call. Similarly, if a device is removed from service
or from a call, its dynamically-assigned Device
<br>Identifier shall become invalid.
<p>Identifiers can be reused. Once an identifier has lost its context it
may be re-used to identify another object. It is
<br>recommended that implementations not re-use identifiers immediately.
<p>Individual Call and Device Identifiers are not guaranteed to be globally
unique. CSTA requires that the combination
<br>of Call and Device Identifier be unique within a CSTA switching sub-domain.
To accomplish this, either the Call
<br>Identifier, or the Device Identifier (or both) shall be unique. In
many cases the Connection Identifier requires both
<br>the Call and Device Identifiers to uniquely refer to Connections in
a call.
