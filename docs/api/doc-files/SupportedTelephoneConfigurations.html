<table border>
	<tr>
		<th>Telephone Configuration</th>
		<th>Administered Set Type</th>
		<th>Administered Port Address</th>
		<th>Affect on Physical Telephone</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>DCP telephone</td>
		<td>Any DCP type that can be administered for softphone access</td>
		<td>Physical port address, such as 1B0201.</td>
		<td>If an application requests exclusive control,
		the telephone either goes dead or becomes a TTI set,
		depending on how it is administered.
		After the application relinquishes control,
		control goes back to the DCP telephone.
		<p />
		If an application requests shared control,
		the telephone stays active.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>DCP extension administered without hardware (AWOH)</td>
		<td>Any DCP type that can be administered for softphone access</td>
		<td>&quot;X&quot;</td>
		<td>Not applicable</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IP telephone that is logged in</td>
		<td>Any IP type that can be administered for softphone access</td>
		<td>Internal software port address, such as S00031, is automatically assigned.</td>
		<td>If an application requests exclusive control,
		the IP telephone is logged off.
		When the application relinquishes control,
		the IP telephone must be powered off and on again to be logged back
		on.
		<p />
		If an application requests shared control,
		the telephone stays active.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IP extension without hardware (i.e., no IP telephone logged in using that extension)</td>
		<td>Any IP type that can be administered for softphone access</td>
		<td>Internal software port address, such as S00031, is automatically assigned. </td>
		<td>Not applicable</td>
