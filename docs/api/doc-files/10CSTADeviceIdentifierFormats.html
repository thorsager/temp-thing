10 CSTA Device Identifier Formats</h1>

<h2>
10.1 Device Identifier Formats</h2>
The possible types of Device Identifiers formats are:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Diallable Digits</i> - this format is a sequence of characters to be
dialled to reach a device. The sequence of characters may contain diallable
digits and/or special characters that specify to the switching function
how digits should be dialled (“,” indicates that a pause should be inserted
into the dialling sequence, for example). This format must be used when
special dialling characters are required or when it is necessary to provide
partial or incomplete dialling sequences.</li>

<li>
<i>Switching Function Representation</i> - this format is a sequence of
characters that is used to reference devices within a switching sub-domain.
In addition to specifying the directory number of the device, it also provides
the ability to specify call appearance, agent identifier, subaddress, name,
etc.</li>

<li>
<i>Device Number</i> - this format is an non-diallable, integer representation
of a Device Identifier. This format of Device Identifier can be used to
reference switching sub-domain devices that may not be typically associated
with a diallable number such as trunks, line cards, etc.</li>
</ul>
In this section, the following example will be reflected. The called number
is a subscriber in the US (country code
<br>1) in San Jose (area code 408). The local number is 996 1010. The extension
is 321. The name of the subscriber is
<br>“John Smith”.
<h3>
10.1.1 Diallable Digits</h3>
<b>Generic Format:</b> DD
<p>A first character of the Device Identifier string which is not “N” indicates
that the Device Identifier uses the
<br>Diallable Digits format. This format may contain from 0 (a null formatted
Device Identifier) to 64 characters. DD is
<br>a string of dialling commands/digits. The following is the list of
the complete set of permitted dialling commands/
<br>digits and their definitions:

</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>The comma character indicates that dialling is to be paused. Thelength
of the pause is provided by the switching function through the capabilitiesexchange
services. Multiple commas can be used to create a long pause.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>W</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The character W followed by a string of digits indicates that thestring
of digits is to be dialled only after dial tone has been detectedby the
switching function.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>@</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The “at” symbol indicates that the switching function shall waitfor
“Quiet Answer” before dialling the rest of the string. This means that
the switching function shall wait for remote ringing indication followedby
5 seconds of silence.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$</td>

<td>This dollar sign indicates that the switching function shall wait for
the billing signal (i.e., credit
<br>card prompt tone) before continuing.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>;</td>

<td>The semi-colon character indicates that the digit string is incomplete
and more digits will be dialled
<br>using the Dial Digits service. This character may only be used in a
Diallable String Device
<br>Identifier.</td>
</tr>

<h4>
Examples:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
If the number is called from France (country prefix 003), the string is
“00,14089961010W321”.</li>

<li>
If the number is called from a switch in New York (dial 9 to get outside
line), the string is“9,14089961010W321”.</li>

<li>
If the number is called from San Jose, the string is “9961010W321”.</li>

<li>
If the number is called from inside the subscriber’s PBX, the string is
“321”.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Functional Requirements:</h4>

<ol>
<li>
The switching function shall accept, as a minimum, digits 0-9 of this format
when the computing function wants to make a call.</li>

<li>
The diallable digits format shall be used to represent a device’s dialling
sequence. A device’s dialling sequence is a string of outband digits used
to initiate a call with another device. When placing a call from a device
to another device, there are basically two ways a device’s dialling sequence
can be used:</li>

<ol>
<li>
The entire sequence of digits is dialled to reach the destination. This
is the most common way to place a call.</li>

<li>
The dialling sequence is broken up into a number of stages in order to
execute and complete the call. This is called “multi-stage” dialling in
this Standard. This type of dialling is needed in cases where the switching
function prompts the device for more digits (by sending dialtone again
or some other tone).</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p><br>Note that switching functions support different combinations of
dialling sequences.

<h3>
10.1.2 Switching Function Representation</h3>
<b>Generic Format:</b> N&lt;DN!SA&amp;CA/EXT%AID>NM (in this order)
<p>The syntax of the generic format is broken down as follows:
<table BORDER=3 CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3 >
<tr>
<td>
<dl>N</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The “N” character at the beginning of the Device Identifier string
(which is 2 to 64 characters in length) indicates that the Device Identifier
uses the Switching Function Representation format. At least one of the
following components needs to be present in this format:</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>&lt; ></dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The angled brackets characters encompass the string when a name (NM)
string representing the person associated with the device is provided after
the “>” character. If the character “&lt;” is not the first character in
the string after the N then the string will not have a name string associated
with it.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>DN</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The first string of characters represents the Directory Number (DN)associated
with the given device. The Directory Number shall contain characters selected
from the following set: “0” through “9”, “*”, “#”, DTMF digits “A”through
“D”. The Directory Number may use any of the following notations (refer
to ISO/IEC 11571, ITU-T E.131):
<br>• Implicit TON (Type Of Number) (example: “0014089961010”4)
<br>• PublicTON - unknown
<br>• PublicTON - international number (example: “14089961010”)
<br>• PublicTON - national (example: “4089961010”)
<br>• PublicTON - subscriber (example: “9961010”)
<br>• PublicTON - abbreviated (example: “17”)
<br>• PrivateTON - unknown
<br>• PrivateTON - level 3 regional (example: “41396557321”)
<br>• PrivateTON - level 2 regional (example: “96557321”)
<br>• PrivateTON - level 1 regional (example: “557321”)
<br>• PrivateTON - local (example: “321”)
<br>• PrivateTON - abbreviated (example: “2”)
<br>• Other (other numbering plans)
<br>• Generic (the notation is unknown)</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>!</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>This exclamation mark character represents the start of a Sub-Address(SA)
string. If the “!” character is not present then there will be no sub-address
associated with this Device Identifier string. The terminationcharacter
for the sub-address string will be the next key character foundin the string
or null.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>&amp;</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The ampersand symbol represents the start of a Call Appearance(CA)
string. It is added to the logical element’s device identifier to uniquely
identify an addressable standard appearance. The value of the string is
switching function specific. The valid characters for the call appearance
string are 0-9. The termination character for the call appearance string
will be the next key character found in the string or null. Refer to 6.1.3.2.1,
“Appearance”.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>/</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The slash symbol represents the start of a physical element extension
(EXT) string. It is added to the logical element’s device identifier to
uniquely identify a bridged appearance. Its value is the physical element’s
device identifier that is associated with the appearance. The termination
character for the physical element extension string will be the next key
character found in the string or null. Refer to 6.1.3.2.1, “Appearance”.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>%</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The percent sign represents the start of an Agent ID (AID) string.
This string represents an ACD agent identifier associated with a device.
This string may be present when the computing function wants to focus a
service at a specific agent identifier that is associated with a device
or when the switching function generates an event that is associated with
a particular device and agent. The valid characters for the agent identifier
string are A-Z and 0-9. If the “%” character is not present then there
will be no agent identifier associated with this Device Identifier string.The
termination character for the agent identifier string will be the next
key character found in the string or null.</dl>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<dl>NM</dl>
</td>

<td>
<dl>The name string (NM) represents the person associated with the device.This
string can be used for selecting a Device Identifier associated with a
user or for logging and informational purposes. The name string may contain
any character.</dl>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>
Example:</h4>
• If the Device Identifier is PublicTON International, then the string
can be “N14089961010”.
<br>• If the Device Identifier is PublicTON Subscriber, then the string
can be “N&lt;9961010>John Smith”.
<h4>
Functional Requirements:</h4>
1. This format shall always contain at least a directory number string
or an agent ID string.
<br>2. The interpretation of additional digits beyond those that are required
to reach a destination are switching
<br>function specific.
<br>3. When there is more than one bridged appearance associated with a
single physical element (see 6.1.3.3.6,
<br>“Hybrid”, on page 19 for an example) there are two methods for representing
these appearances: One is to
<br>have a unique call appearance (CA) and physical element extension (EXT)
combination for each appearance
<br>where EXT is used to represent the given physical element and CA is
used to represent multiple appearances
<br>associated with the same physical element. The other is to have a single
EXT for each appearance,
<br>independently of their association with the physical element. In either
case, the resulting Device Identifier is
<br>unique for the given appearance.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
10.1.3 Device Number</h3>
<b>Generic Format:</b>
<p>The Device Number format represents a Device Identifier using an integer.
The
integer shall be maximum size of
<br>four octets.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
10.2 Functional Requirements</h2>
1. If the switching function detects a problem with a Device Identifier,
the service will be rejected with a
<br>negative acknowledgement.
<br>2. The switching function may use any format in service acknowledgements
and events.
<br>3. For Device Identifiers in service requests, the computing function
should check the deviceIDFormat parameter
<br>in a capabilities exchange service to determine:
<dl>• Which formats are supported.
<br>• For the Switching Function Representation format, which notations
are supported.
<br>• For the Diallable Digits format, which special characters are supported.</dl>
4. When providing a null Device Identifier, the Diallable Digits Format
is used.</dl>
