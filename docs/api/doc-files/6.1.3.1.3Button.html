<i>This description is taken from ECMA 269, Section 6.1.3.1.3, "Button".</i>
<h5>
<font size=+0>6.1.3.1.3 Button</font></h5>
A button is a component which executes a specific feature/service that
is assigned to it. The most common
<br>implementation of this component, is a piece of hardware that is pressed
and released, thereby executing the feature/
<br>service assigned to it (e.g., each of the number buttons on a station).
However, an implementation can use any
<br>component that can produce a similar behaviour. A button can also have
the capability of toggling between two
<br>settings of a feature/service (e.g., enabling and disabling Do Not
Disturb, that is you press the button once, it
<br>enables the Do Not Disturb feature/service, and press again, it disables
the feature/service). The button can also
<br>have the capability of looping through a series of features/services.
Almost any feature/service or set of features/
<br>services can be assigned to a button, but generally a switching function
makes visible buttons only with features/
<br>services that are not available through the components/attributes/features/services
defined in this Standard. A
<br>button can also be used to represent another physical component (e.g.,
a hookswitch). A physical element can have
<br>many buttons associated with it. Each button can be used independently
of each other. A button has the following
<br>attributes which can be controlled and observed by the computing function:
<p>1. Button Identifier - Each button that can be observed and/or controlled
within the switching function is
<br>referenced using an assigned identifier. The button identifiers associated
with a given physical element’s
<br>Device Identifier are unique. This identifier is used to control and
observe all other button attributes.
<p>2. Button Label - This is a label by which people interacting with the
physical device refer to a given button.
<br>This label is a character string which is retained by the switching
function. This attribute can also be changed
<br>(if supported) by the computing function. The meaning of a Button Label
is specific to the users of a particular
<br>device and changing it does not change the function of the button.
<p>3. Button Function - This is a feature which can be assigned by the
switching function to describe the function
<br>associated with a given button. The switching function may reassign
the functionality of a button and change
<br>this attribute as required (in response to other button presses, for
example) but it may not be changed directly
<br>by the computing function.
<p>4. Button Associated Number - This is a diallable digits format Device
Identifier which is associated with the
<br>feature/service assigned to the button. This Device Identifier is used
by the feature/service when it is executed
<br>by the button being pressed. This attribute is optional and only applies
to buttons that have some form of
<br>associated number. This Device Identifier is initially assigned by
the switching function and can be changed
<br>(if supported) at any time by either the switching or computing function.
<p>5. Button Press Indicator - This indicates if the button can be pressed
via the Button Press service.
