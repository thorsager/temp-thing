<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section
12.3.9, "ConnectionID".</i>
<h3>
12.3.9 ConnectionID</h3>
The ConnectionID parameter type describes a device’s connection in a given
call.
<p><b>Format</b>
The ConnectionID is always comprised of the following parameters (except
in special cases which are described
below):
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; callID (M) Octet String - An identifier used by
the switching function to represent a valid call. The maximum length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supported by the switching function
is provided via the capabilities exchange services. These IDs are created
by the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switching function and are globally
unique among all calls within the switching sub-domain.
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deviceID (M) DeviceID - An identifier which is
used to represent a device in the switching sub-domain. This identifier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be either one of the two following
values:
&nbsp;
<blockquote>• Static - This type of identifier is defined in ECMA 269,
section 6.1.3, “Device”.
<p>• Dynamic - This type of identifier is one that is created by the switching
function for a device when it
enters into a call and shall remain constant for the life of the device’s
participation in the call (i.e., the
creation of a connection identifier for the device). As soon as the
device leaves the call, the identifier
becomes invalid. The use of a dynamic identifier by a switching function
is determined when the
switching function does not have a static identifier for the device
or the identifier can not uniquely identify
the device in a call. This type of identifier is an octet string. It
is never a dialable number and can never be
used outside the context of the connection identifier. This type of
identifier is not directly related to a
device element but is strictly used to make the connection identifier
unique. Refer to ECMA 269, section 6.1.8, “Management of Dynamically-Assigned
Identifiers”, for more information.</blockquote>
<b>Functional Requirements</b>
1. The computing function shall not fabricate its own Connection IDs.
This will lead to unpredictable results.
<p>2. The Connection IDs in events and service acknowledgements are always
allocated by the switching function.
<p>3. Computing functions can extract Device IDs from Connection IDs and
use them on services that have Device
ID parameters only if the Device ID extracted is a static Device ID
that the switching function accepts.
Otherwise, the Device ID cannot be used.
<p>4. Computing functions shall extract Call IDs from Connection IDs, provided
by the switching function, to
correlate event reports associated with devices that are connected
together in a call.
<p>5. The computing function will always receive an event to indicate the
termination of a Connection ID if the
appropriate monitor is started. Refer to the individual services and
events to better understand the meaning of
individual events with respect to connection states.
<p>6. If the computing function issues a service with a Connection ID that
cannot be controlled by the switching
function, the service will be rejected with a negative acknowledgement.
<p>7. Connection IDs used as parameters can only have three formats:
<ul>
<li>
A complete Connection ID (i.e., call ID and device ID). This extracted
from either events received by the computing function or positive acknowledgements
received as a result of services issued. When supplied as a parameter,
the Connection ID will be validated by the switching function with respect
to the service being issued. If this Connection ID is not valid, the service
request will be rejected with a negative acknowledgement.</li>

<li>
A DeviceID only Connection ID. If a service has more than one Connection
ID parameter, the switching function supports this type of Connection ID,
and the computing function wants to use this type of Connection ID, then
all Connection ID parameters in the service shall be of this type. If this
type of Connection ID is used as the Connection ID parameter for a service,
then rules documented in the services sections will determine whether it
is accepted or not by the switching function. If this type of Connection
ID is not accepted, then the service will be rejected with a negative acknowledgement.</li>

<li>
A Call ID only Connection ID. In events, this format can only be used for
the Call Cleared and Failed event. If this format is used for any service
other than Clear Call, Monitor Start, or Snapshot Call, it will be rejected
with a negative acknowledgement.</li>
</ul>
8. If a call changes its Call ID when a Conference or Transfer occurs,
Connection IDs shall be provided to link
the old Call IDs to the new Call IDs. When this occurs, the event will
contain a list of originally known
Connection IDs of devices that are still in the call along with the
new replacement Connection IDs. When the
new Connection IDs are created in such cases, new dynamic Device IDs
may also be used to create the
Connection IDs.
<p>9. Connection IDs that come from the switching function (events and
positive acknowledgements to services)
will always contain both the Call ID and Device ID portions (see item
7a above) except for the Call Cleared
and Failed events that may also contain only a valid call ID in the
connection ID (see item 7c above).
<p>10. The computing function should never assume the reuse of callIDs,
although some switching functions may
reuse one or the other.
