<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section 6.1.4.4,
"User Data".</i>
<h4>
6.1.4.4 User Data</h4>
User Data is call-related computing function-to-computing function information
that, unlike Correlator Data, is not associated with a call for the life
of the call. The switching function receives User Data in two ways:
<ul>
<li>
A computing function sends User Data in a service request.</li>

<li>
User Data arrives from an external network connection with a call (for
example, User Data may be used as a key to pop a screen for the call).</li>
</ul>
Both a computing function and the network may send User Data in two ways:
<ul>
<li>
<i>With Call Control Activity</i> - Call control service requests (and
network signalling for call control) permit User Data as an optional parameter.
The switching function reflects the delivery of User Data in the first
call control event that results from the switching function or network
carrying out the call control activity. When the computing function provides
User Data in a Call Control service request, the User Data is delivered
to other parties if and only if the call control service successfully completes.
If the switching function does not generate the call control event that
corresponds to the call control activity because the computing function
has set an event filter that filters out the relevant event, then the User
Data is not propagated to subsequent events and the User Data information
will be lost. Refer to the description of the individual Call Control services
for more details on the events that will contain User Data for those services.</li>

<li>
<i>Independent of Call Control Activity </i>- The computing function may
use the Send User Information service to pass User Data at any time. Some
networks provide an independent signalling mechanism for sending User Data.
The switching function generates a Call Information event with the userData
parameter containing the received User Data to reflect the delivery of
the User Data. Independent of call control activity, this event is generated
for all computing functions monitoring the call and all computing functions
monitoring any CSTA Devices that have a connection to that all. This Standard
defines one possible mechanism for delivering User Data through an external
network. This mechanism is described in Annex B.</li>
</ul>
When a computing function uses a service to send User Data, the switching
function sends that User Data only after the switching function sends a
positive acknowledgement to the service request. User Data is described
further in <a href="12.2.27UserData.html">12.2.27UserData</a>.
