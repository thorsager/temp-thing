<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section
12.2.10, "Correlator Data".</i>
<h3>
12.2.10 CorrelatorData</h3>
The CorrelatorData parameter type contains computing sub-domain specific
data that has been or will be attached to a call that the computing function
is controlling or monitoring. This allows the computing function to associate
its own information with a call and, as a result, share it with other computing
functions. For example, this information might be a key to a database entry,
a computing function command sequence, file name, etc. This feature is
useful when calls are moving from one computing function to another in
a distributed computer network or from one switching sub-domain to another.
<p>See&nbsp; <a href="6.1.4.3CorrelatorData.html">6.1.4.3CorrelatorData</a>
for specific rules on the use of Correlator Data. ECMA 269, Annex B defines
one possible mechanism for delivering correlator data through an external
ISDN network.
<h4>
Format</h4>
This parameter type is an octet string. The maximum length supported by
the switching function is provided via the capabilities exchange services.
<h4>
Functional Requirements</h4>

<ol>
<li>
The correlator data will stay with the call as long as the call exists.
This means that the correlator data will be presented to the computing
function on events that have this parameter and that the switching sub-domain
supports.</li>

<li>
The correlator data can be changed during the life of the call by any of
the services that has the parameter or by using the Associate Data service.</li>

<li>
The way to clear the data on the call is to pass a null string of data
on one of the above mentioned services. (The actual parameter is passed
but the content is a null string.) If correlator data is cleared, then
the switching function notifies the computing function by sending a null
string.</li>

<li>
See&nbsp; <a href="6.1.4.3CorrelatorData.html">6.1.4.3CorrelatorData</a>
for a description of how Correlator Data is inherited by calls during a
conference or transfer.</li>

<li>
If the computing function issues the Consultation Call service without
correlator data, initially the secondary call will not have correlator
data associated with it, as it does not inherit any correlator data that
may be associated with the primary call. If the computing function issues
the Consultation Call service with correlator data, this data is for the
secondary call only and does not affect any correlator data that may be
currently associated with the primary call.</li>

<li>
When correlator data is associated with a call, for all Call Control events
listed in ECMA 269, Section 17.2 except for the Bridged, Call Cleared,
Connection Cleared, Held, and the Retrieved events (i.e. call events that
may indicate that a device becomes part of a call) shall include the correlator
data (if supported). Correlator data can optionally be included with the
four event exceptions listed above.</li>

<li>
When this data is being attached to a call through a service request, its
association shall be completed prior to any state transitions resulting
from the request. Thus any state transition events which contain this parameter
shall contain the information passed on the request.</li>

<li>
If a computing function issues a Snapshot Call service after a service
request has been issued with this information, but prior to the switching
function making any state transitions, it is switching function specific
as to what will be returned in the positive acknowledgement with regards
to this parameter.</li>
