</head>
<body>
<i>This description is taken from ECMA-269, Section
12.2.25, "System Status".</i>
<h3>
12.2.25 SystemStatus</h3>
The SystemStatus parameter type indicates the reason for the System Status
service request.
<p><b>Format</b>
<p>The complete set of possible values are:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Disabled - Existing Monitor Requests have been disabled. Other requests
and acknowledgements also may be disabled, but negative acknowledgements
should always be provided.</li>

<li>
Partially Disabled - Some of the objects in the system can not be reached.
Existing monitors on these objects will not provide events and computer
requests targeting these objects will be rejected. This cause indicates
to the receiving function that a degradation of service level may occur
but not complete system disability. Automatic or manual actions may be
taken to remedy the parts disabled.</li>

<li>
Enabled - Requests and acknowledgements have been enabled. This usually
occurs after a disruption or restart. This status cause is always sent
after an Initializing cause has been sent and may be sent under other conditions.
This status indicates that there are no outstanding monitors (existing
monitors and their associated monito cross reference identifiers are no
longer valid).</li>

<li>
Initializing - The system is initializing or restarting. This status indicates
that a system is temporarily unable to respond to any requests. If provided,
this status message is followed by an Enabled status message to indicate
that the initialization process has completed.</li>

<li>
Messages Lost - Requests and/or acknowledgements, including event reports,
may have been lost.</li>

<li>
Normal - May be sent at any time and indicates that the status is normal.
This status has no effect on other Services.</li>

<li>
Overload Imminent - The receiver is requested to take initiative to shed
load.</li>

<li>
Overload Reached - The requester may take initiative to shed load. This
cause may be followed by Stop Monitor requests sent to the client and by
rejections to additional service requests.</li>

<li>
Overload Relieved - The overload condition has passed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
