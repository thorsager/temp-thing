<h2>Using Listeners in the Device, Media & Call Control (DMCC) API</h2>
Java listeners are used to implement the CSTA concept called
<a href="6.7.2Monitoring.html">monitoring</a>.
Adding a listener to a device is
equivalent to requesting a Monitor Start service for that device.
Listeners are used to asynchronously notify your applications of events
that occur.
<p />
The Device, Media & Call Control (DMCC) API provides multiple types of listeners,
one or more per service.
For example, <tt>PhysicalDeviceServices</tt> has
<tt>PhysicalDeviceListener</tt> to detect
events on a physical device, whereas
<tt>TerminalServices</tt> has both <tt>TerminalListener</tt> and
<tt>MediaControlListener</tt> to detect
events regarding device registration and a device's media stream, respectively.
Each service may also have a listener adapter,
such as <tt>PhysicalDeviceAdapter</tt>
and <tt>TerminalAdapter</tt>.
<p />
Each listener interface provides a callback method declaration for each type of
event that can occur, but no implementation. In contrast,
a listener adapter implements the listener interface with a default "do nothing"
implementation for each declared method.
<p />
When an event occurs, the corresponding listener callback is called.
If you want your application to
act upon events, you can customize the events' callbacks for your application
in either of the following ways:
<ul><li>Provide an implementation of every callback method in
     a listener interface with a class that implements the listener.</li>
<li>Provide an implementation of a subset of callback methods
    with a class that extends the adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p />
To receive notification of events, your application must then
add your listener implementation using
<tt>MonitoringServices.add<i>XXX</i>Listener</tt> method.
For example, to add an implementation of <tt>PhysicalDeviceListener</tt> (or
an extension to <tt>PhysicalDeviceAdapter</tt>)
that you have named <tt>myPhysDevListenerImpl</tt>, use:
<pre>
monitoringServices.addPhysicalDeviceListener(myDevice, myPhysDevListenerImpl);
</pre>
Note that there is one exception to this. When adding a <tt>SystemStatusListener</tt>,
you add the listener using System Services, instead of Monitoring Services:
<pre>
systemServices.addSystemStatusListener(mySwitch, mySystemListenerImpl);
</pre>
Also note that events that occur prior to adding a listener are not reported.
<p />
If multiple listeners are added to a device, then each listener will be notified
of events on that device; the corresponding callback will be called on each
listener that has been added.
<p />
To cease event reports, your application must remove the added listener
by using the <tt>MonitoringServices.remove<i>XXX</i>Listener</tt> method or the
<tt>SystemServices.removeSystemStatusListener</tt> method.
