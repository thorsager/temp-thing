<body>
Contains constants used by Communication Manager to represent
button types/functions, button addresses/IDs, lamp modes,
and ringer types/patterns used in PhysicalDeviceServices.
The application must use these values when specifying
buttons, lamps and ringers in service requests, such as
when specifying which button to press or which lamp to obtain status on.
The application may also have to interpret values sent to it in responses and
events. For example, if you requested button information for all the buttons
on a device
using the <code>getButtonInformation()</code> request, then the response would
contain a list of all the buttons on that device, each one identified by its
button ID and button function.
