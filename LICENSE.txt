You must ensure that Your End Users using applications, interfaces, value-added services and/or solutions, workflows or processes that incorporate the API, Client Libraries, Sample Code or Permitted Modifications adhere to these terms, and You agree to notify Avaya promptly if You become aware of any breach of the terms of Licensee EULA that may impact Avaya. You will take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the SDK and notify Avaya promptly of any such unauthorized access or use.
C. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it is licensed to use the SDK only in connection with Avaya products (and if applicable, in connection with services provided by or on behalf of Avaya).
D. With respect to Software that contains elements provided by third party suppliers, Licensee may install and use the Software in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable license agreements, such as "shrinkwrap" or "click-through" licenses, accompanying or applicable to the Software.

2.2 No Standalone Product. Nothing in this Agreement authorizes or grants Licensee any rights to distribute or otherwise make available to a third party the SDK, in whole or in part, or any Derivative Work in source or object code format on a standalone basis other than the modifications permitted in Section 2.1B of this Agreement.

2.3 Proprietary Notices. Licensee shall not remove any copyright, trade mark or other proprietary notices incorporated in the copies of the SDK, Sample Application Code and redistributable files in Licensee's possession or control or any modifications thereto. Redistributions in binary form or other suitable program format for distribution, to the extent expressly permitted, must also reproduce Avaya's copyright, trademarks or other proprietary notices as incorporated in the SDK in any associated Documentation or "splash screens" that display Licensee copyright notices.

2.4 Third-Party Components. You acknowledge certain software programs or portions thereof included in the SDK may contain software distributed under third party agreements ("Third Party Components"), which may contain terms that expand or limit rights to use certain portions of the SDK ("Third Party Terms"). Information identifying the copyright holders of the Third Party Components and the Third Party Terms that apply is available in the attached Schedule 1 (if any), SDK, Documentation, or on Avaya's web site at: http://support.avaya.com/Copyright (or such successor site as designated by Avaya). The open source software license terms provided as Third Party Terms are consistent with the license rights granted in this Agreement, and may contain additional rights benefiting You, such as modification and distribution of the open source software.

To the extent that fees are associated with the license of the SDK, Licensee agrees to pay to Avaya or pay directly to the applicable government or taxing authority, if requested by Avaya, all taxes and charges, including without limitation, penalties and interest, which may be imposed by any federal, state or local governmental or taxing authority arising hereunder excluding, however, all taxes computed upon Avaya's net income. If You move any Software, including the SDK, and as a result of such move, a jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee (including withholding taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of any such Software), then You are solely liable for, and agree to pay, any such duty, taxes, levy or other fees.

2.12(b) Audit. Avaya shall have the right, at its cost and expense, to inspect and/or audit (i) by remote polling or other reasonable electronic means at any time and (ii) in person during normal business hours and with reasonable notice Licensee's books, records, and accounts, to determine Licensee's compliance with this Agreement. In the event such inspection or audit uncovers non-compliance with this Agreement, then without prejudice to Avaya's termination rights hereunder, Licensee shall promptly pay Avaya any applicable license fees. Licensee agrees to keep a current record of the location of the SDK.

2.16 Disclaimer. Any software security feature is not a guaranty against malicious code, deleterious routines, and other techniques and tools employed by computer "hackers" and other third parties to create security exposures. Compromised passwords represent a major security risk. Avaya encourages You to create strong passwords using three different character types, change Your password regularly and refrain from using the same password regularly. You must treat such information as confidential. You agree to notify Avaya immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use or breach of Your user name, password, account, API Key, or other credentials as provided by Avaya for use of the SDK, or subscription. You are responsible for ensuring that Your networks and systems are adequately secured against unauthorized intrusion or attack and regularly back up of Your data and files in accordance with good computing practices.

15.3 Arbitration of Non-US Disputes. If a Dispute that arose anywhere other than in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth in Section 15.2, it will be conclusively determined upon request of either party by a final and binding arbitration proceeding to be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross claims and counterclaims by any one party against the other party exceed One Million US Dollars at the time all claims, including cross claims and counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a panel of three arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.

15.4 Choice of Forum for US Disputes. If a Dispute by one party against the other that arose in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed in the United States cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth in Section 15.2, then either party may bring an action or proceeding solely in either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
